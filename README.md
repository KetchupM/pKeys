Addon for Garry's Mod that implements a similar system to Teamspeak 3's privilege keys.

Modify the config file at pkeys/lua/autorun/pkeyConfig.lua

Run the sql.txt in your database that you've comfigured the addon to in sv_pkeys.lua

You need mysqloo for it to work on your server.
Remember to configure the databases in sv_pkeys.lua and generator.php
